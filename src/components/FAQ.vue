      <BAccordionItem title="How do I choose the right frame size?">
        <strong>To choose the right frame size.</strong> you'll need to consider
        three main measurements: lens width, bridge width, and temple length,
        all in millimeters (mm). You can find these measurements on the inside
        of your current frames or measure your face. A good fit should rest
        comfortably on the bridge of your nose and ears without pinching or
        discomfort

      <BAccordionItem title="Can I try on glasses before purchasing?">
        <strong>While online shopping doesn't offer physical try-ons.</strong>
        we provide a virtual try-on feature. Simply upload a photo of your face
        or use your webcam to see how different frames look on you. This can
        help you get a better idea of the style and fit before you buy.

        Round frames may complement angular faces, while square or angular
        frames can flatter rounder faces. Colors that contrast with your skin
        tone can also stand out more. Using our virtual try-on feature can also
        give you a good indication of how a pair will look.
